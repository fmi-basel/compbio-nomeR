\title{nomeR: A package that uses a probabilistic model for better interpreting NOME-Seq data}
\description{
The package uses a probabilistic model for calculating posterior probabilities that a certain position 
in a NOME-Seq read is covered by a certain DNA binding protein.
}
\section{nomeR functions}{

\code{create_data_list} - function for preprocessing a NOME-Seq matrix containing information about 
"protected" and "unprotected" positions in each read. Rows must represent reads (fragments) and columns must represent positions in the amplicon.

  
\code{run_nomeR} - function which runs probabilistic model and returns a data.frame with posterior probabilities.
}
