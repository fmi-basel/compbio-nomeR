\title{nomeR: Probabilistic model for NOME-Seq data analysis}
\description{
This packages uses a probabilistic model for analysis of NOMe-Seq data, 
or any other kind of data that gives single molecule occupancy read out.
}
\details{
The model allows to perform two types of analysis.
}
\section{1. Inference of footprint abundances in NOMe-seq data}{



This analysis can be done when the main question is what footprints are present in the data.
By counting occurences of observing combinations of protected/unprotected positions at all possible distances
and using a bayesian model we make avalilable two algorithms for footprint inference.

\itemize{
\item {Sampling from posterior distribution using Monte Carlo methods from `rstan` package (\code{infer_footprints_stan_sampling});
}
\item {Approximation of posterior distribution using variational Bayes from `rstan` package (\code{infer_footprints_stan_vb}).}
\item {Finding maximum a posteriori point estimate using optimization algorithms provided by 'rstan' (infer_footprints_stan_optimizing).}
}
}

\section{2. Prediction of footprint positions in NOMe-seq data}{


When footprint abundances are known or inferred from the analysis in previous section one can predict positions of 
footprints in the NOMe-seq data (\code{predict_footprints}). We calculate posterior probabilities for each footprint to start or to cover 
each position in each fragment.
