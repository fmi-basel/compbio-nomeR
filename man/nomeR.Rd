\title{nomeR: A package that uses a probabilistic model for interpreting NOME-Seq data}
\description{
The package uses a probabilistic model for calculating posterior probabilities that a certain position 
in a NOME-Seq read is covered by a certain footprint.
}
\section{nomeR functions}{


  
\code{run_nomeR} - function which takes as input 1) a matrix with NOME-Seq data where rows represent reads (or fragments)
and columns represent positions in the amplicon, 2) models for a set of user-defined footprints,
and using a probabilistic model it returns a data.frame with posterior probabilities for each position and fragment to be covered by each footprint.
