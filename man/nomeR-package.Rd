A DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE

Regulation of gene expression by DNA binding proteins, such as sequence specific transcription factor (TF), is a key step which drives a plethora of biological processes.
During the past decade, remarkable achievements have been made in understanding how TFs regulate their targets  using ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq assays.
However, these assays provide only averaged information of larger cell populations. Hence, such assays are unable to detect states of binding at single-DNA-molecule resolution.
In contrast, emerging single-molecule footprinting (SMF) technologies, such as the Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing (NOMe-seq) assay, provide information
about states of binding sites at single-DNA-molecule resolution and allow better molecular characterization of inherently stochastic processes of protein-DNA interactions.

Despite the many advantages that single molecule footprinting technologies bring for studying mechanisms of gene regulation,
rigorous statistical models for the analysis of datasets generated using these technologies are still missing.
Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first statistical model for inference and predictions of footprints for unbiased quantitative analysis and interpretation of SMF datasets.
