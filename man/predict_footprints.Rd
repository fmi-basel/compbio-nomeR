\title{Function for calculating coverage probabilities for footprints in single-molecule-footprinting (SMF) data}
\usage{
predict_footprints(
  data,
  footprint_models,
  bgprotectprob,
  bgcoverprior,
  report_prediction_in_flanks = FALSE,
  ncpu = 1L,
  verbose = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{matrix} or \code{list} containing SMF data. If data is a \code{matrix} rows represent reads (or fragments),
columns represent positions in region of interest (ROI). If data is a \code{list} than each element must contain vector with SMF data.
NOTE that \code{data} must contain data for informative positions '0' represents accessible (methylated) position,
and '1' represents protected (unmethylated) position "C" and all other positions must be filled with "NA".}

\item{footprint_models}{A list containing footprint models for proteins.
Each element must have 3 slots:
PROTECT_PROB - a numeric vector with footprint emission probabilities to find protected position within a footprint;
COVER_PRIOR - prior coverage probability (abundance) (\code{numeric}) reflecting what fraction of reads you expect to be covered by a footprint;
NAME - name (\code{character}) of a model, e.g. "Nucleosome".}

\item{bgprotectprob}{background emission probability to find a protected position within open (accessible) regions}

\item{bgcoverprior}{prior probability for percentage of all fragments to be in a free (accessible, or background) state}

\item{report_prediction_in_flanks}{\code{logical} whether to return calculated start probabilities in left flanking region.
In order to take into account partial footprints at left edge of fragments the algorithm extends each fragment by maximum footprint length on the left side.
\code{report_prediction_in_flanks} controls whether calculated start probabilities in the left flanking region will be reported in the \code{START_PROB} .}

\item{ncpu}{number of threads to use}

\item{verbose}{verbose mode for bug fixing}
}
\value{
A list which contains 3 data frames:
        \code{START_PROB} - data frame with calculated start probabilities for each SMF molecule (column \code{seq}),
                            each position in ROI (column \code{pos}) and each footprint model, e.g. Nucleosome, background etc.
                            These probabilities reflect how likely it is to find a start in each fragment and at each position of a certain footprint model.

        \code{COVER_PROB} - data frame with calculated coverage probabilities for each SMF molecule (column \code{seq}),
                            each position in ROI (column \code{pos}) and each footprint model, e.g. Nucleosome, background etc.
                            These probabilities reflect how likely it is that a certain position in an amplicon and certain fragment is covered by a certain footprint model.
