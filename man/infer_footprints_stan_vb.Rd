\arguments{
\item{joint_freq_table}{\code{data.frame} which must contain columns \code{S}, \code{N00},\code{N01},\code{N10},\code{N11}, 
where \code{S} represent spacings and \code{N00},\code{N01},\code{N10},\code{N11} are observed counts for 00, 01, 10 and 11 at spacing \code{S}.
This table can be obtained using function nomeR::count_joint_frequencies(...)}

\item{footprint_prior_diralphas}{vector containing parameters for dirichlet distribution which is used to model footprint abundances.
Default vector assumes that around 50\% of data is free of any footprints and all other footprint up-to 200bp have uninformative prior.}

\item{bg_protect_prob}{expected probability to observe 1 at a free position. In other words it is emission probability of background for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_min}{minimum allowed value for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_max}{maximum allowed value for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_mean}{expected mean for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_var}{expected variance for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{...}{parameters for `rstan::vb` function. Please check `?rstan::vb`.}
