\title{Truncate protected positions from left and right sides}
\usage{
truncate_footprint_overhangs(data_matr, trunc_until_nbg = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matr}{matrix containing NOMe-Seq data for an amplicon.}

\item{trunc_until_nbg}{number of unprotected positions to stop truncation.}
}
\value{
same matrix as `data_matr` but flanking protected positions are replaced by `NA`.
}
\description{
This function for each row in a matrix containing NOMe-Seq data fills with NA all protected positions from left and right sides until it meets \code{trunc_until_nbg} unprotected positions.
The main aim of this function is to get read of incomplete fottprints which are located at the edges of sequences fragment.
