\title{Function for creating contingency tables of frequencing have 0,0; 0,1, 0,NA etc with spacing S between them}
\usage{
count_spacing_frequencies(data, maxspacing, maxwmlen = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing preprocessed NOMe-Seq data returned from \code{create_data_list}.}

\item{maxspacing}{Maximum spcaing between positions.}

\item{maxwmlen}{A priori maximum length of possible footprint in the data.
If \code{maxwmlen} is not 0, then the sequences are flanked by NA filled artificial sequences on the left and on the right.}
}
\value{
data.frame containing frequencies for 0,0; 0,1; etc for each spacing between 0 (no gap, adjacent positions) and \code{maxspacing}
}
