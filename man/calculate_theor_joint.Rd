\title{Function for calculating theoretical joint probablities at certain distance}
\usage{
calculate_theor_joint(
  ftp_cover_priors,
  bg_protect_prob,
  footprint_protect_prob,
  max_spacing
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ftp_cover_priors}{coverage probabilities for each footprint. 
IMPORTANT! This must be a vector where \code{ftp_cover_priors[1]} is coverage probability of background and we assume that indexes in the vector correspond to the footprint lengths.}

\item{bg_protect_prob}{emission probability for background for \code{1}.}

\item{footprint_protect_prob}{emission probability for footprints for \code{1}.}

\item{max_spacing}{maximum distance}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Using assumption that all non-background footprints have the same emission probabilities we calculate 
theoretical probabilities 
\code{P(0,0|S)}, \code{P(0,1|S)}, \code{P(1,0|S)}, \code{P(1,1|S)} for all distances \code{S} up to \code{max_spacing}.
\code{P(0,0|S)} etc, are probabilities to find \code{0} and \code{0} separated by distance \code{S}.
