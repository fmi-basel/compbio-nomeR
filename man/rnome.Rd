\title{Function for running probabilistic model of interpretation of NOMe-Seq data}
\usage{
rnome(data, binding_models, bgprotectprob, bgprior, bound_fit_tol,
  bound_min_fderiv_val, bound_max_steps, run_priorEM, priorEM_fit_tol,
  priorEM_max_steps)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix containing NOMe-Seq data. Rows represent reads (or fragments), 
columns represent position in an amplicon. NOTE that \code{data} must contain only positions of selected GpCs where '0' represent unprotected "C", 
'1' represent protected "C" and all other positions must be filled with "NA".}

\item{binding_models}{A list containing binding models for proteins. 
Each element must have 3 slops:
PROTECT_PROB - a numeric vector with probability to find protected 'C' within the footprint
PRIOR - prior (numeric) probability reflecting how often we expect to find a footprint
NAME - name (character) of a model, e.g. "Nucleosome"}

\item{bgprotectprob}{probability to find a protected 'C' in open (in reality uprotected) regions}

\item{bgprior}{prior probability for a free (unprotected, or background) position}

\item{bound_fit_tol}{fitting tolerance for estimating initial values of partition sums}

\item{bound_min_fderiv_val}{This value used in Haley's numerical method for solving equations and represent a 
minimal value of denominator in first derivative of a function}

\item{bound_max_steps}{Maximum number of iterations for algorithm which estimates boundary values for partition sums}

\item{run_priorEM}{If TRUE the function runs Expectation Maximization algorithm for fitting prior probabilities of binding objects}

\item{priorEM_fit_tol}{Fitting tolerance for running prior EM}

\item{priorEM_max_steps}{Maximum number of iterations in prior EM}
