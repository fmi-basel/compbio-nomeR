\usage{
init_ftp_model_params_for_hmc(
  dir_alpha = c(200, rep(1, 199)),
  nchains = 4,
  ftp_protect_min = 0.6,
  ftp_protect_max = 0.9999,

}
\arguments{
\item{dir_alpha}{vector containing parameters for dirichlet distribution which is used to model footprint abundances.
Default vector assumes that around 50\% of data is free of any footprints and all other footprint up-to 200bp have uninformative prior.}

\item{nchains}{number of markov chains which will be run.}

\item{ftp_protect_min}{minimum allowed value for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_max}{maximum allowed value for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_mean}{expected mean for footprint emission probability for 1.}

\item{ftp_protect_var}{expected variance for footprint emission probability for 1.}
}
\value{
list of length `nchains` containing initial values for `ftp_abundances` and `footprint_protect_prob`.
