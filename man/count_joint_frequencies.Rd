\title{Create count table for 00, 01, 10, 11, etc occurences in NOMe-Seq data}
\usage{
count_joint_frequencies(data, max_spacing, max_ftplen = 0L, ncpu = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix containing NOMe-Seq data for an amplicon.}

\item{max_spacing}{Maximum spacing between positions.}

\item{max_ftplen}{A priori maximum length of possible footprint in the data.
If \code{max_ftplen} is not 0, then the sequences are extended by \code{max_ftplen} on the left and on the right and filled with NA.}

\item{ncpu}{number of cores to use}
}
\value{
data.frame containing frequencies for 0,0; 0,1; etc for each spacing between 1 (total number of 0s and 1 in the data) and \code{max_spacing}
}
